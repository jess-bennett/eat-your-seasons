                <h1>Why?</h1>
                <p>There are many ways we can all try to reduce our impact on the planet: avoiding single-use plastic, recycling all that we can and taking steps to keep our carbon footprint as low as possible.<br>
                However, many studies show that one of the single biggest ways we can all make a difference, is looking at our diet and changing the way we eat.</p>

                <h1>How?</h1>
                <p>If you have looked into this subject to any extent, you may know what a minefield it is. Which dietary lifestyle is best? Should you become a vegetarian? A vegan? A flexitarian?</p>
                <p>As a family, we have tried it all. And while there are definite benefits to each approach, there are also huge drawbacks. Becoming vegan is often cited as one of the best approaches
                    for an environmentally-sound diet. However, while following a vegan diet ourselves, we found that there's such a huge array of alternative products available (which certainly makes it
                    a much easier diet than it used to be), that the effect on sustainability becomes questionable. Is a "plant-based" meat alternative produced in the US and shipped over to the UK really
                    an environmentally-better product than a free-range chicken breast from a farm just down the road from you? Not necessarily...

                <h1>Tell me more...</h1>
                <p>After a lot of thought, and realisation that there is nothing black-and-white in any of this, we decided to base our diet on the following principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Whole foods (i.e. plant foods that are unprocessed and unrefined, or processed and refined as little as possible - food that you can instantly recognise!) should make up the vast majority of your diet.</li>
                    <li>Meat/fish and animal products should be kept to an absolute minimum and only used when they can be locally sourced (and not factory-farmed or shipped from another country).</li>
                    <li>If you do have to buy processed foods or your only option for meat etc is factory-farmed, then plant-based alternatives are a better choice.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This site is based on the meal plan that we now follow. You can find information on what foods are in season and when. You can see meal suggestions that make the most
                    of seasonal produce. And most importantly (for time-saving and convenience), you can view and customise weekly meal plans and shopping lists to allow you to integrate these changes
                    into your life, as seamlessly as possible.
